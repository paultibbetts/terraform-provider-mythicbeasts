    }

## Schema

### Required

- `data` (String) User data snippet
- `name` (String) User data name

### Read-Only

- `size` (Number) User data size (in bytes)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = mythicbeasts_user_data.example
  id = "123"
}

resource "mythicbeasts_user_data" "example" {
  name = "example-apache"
  data = "#cloud-config\n\npackages:\n  - apache2\n\n"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import mythicbeasts_user_data.example 123
```

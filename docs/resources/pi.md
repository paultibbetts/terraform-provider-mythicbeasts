# mythicbeasts_pi (Resource)

Manages a Raspberry Pi.

~> **Note:** This is a service aimed at hobbyists, and shouldn't be used for nuclear power station command and control systems.

## IPv6

The Pis are on an IPv6-only network. See [`mythicbeasts_proxy_endpoint` resource](../resources/proxy_endpoint) to set up an endpoint for the IPv4 to IPv6 proxy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.11.0"

  required_providers {
    mythicbeasts = {
      source = "paultibbetts/mythicbeasts"
    }
  }
}

resource "mythicbeasts_pi" "example" {
  identifier   = "example"
  disk_size    = 10
  model        = 4
  os_image     = "rpi-bookworm-arm64"
  ssh_key      = "ssh-ed25519 ..."
  wait_for_dns = true
  memory       = 4096
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `identifier` (String) A unique identifier for the server. This will form part of the hostname for the server, and should consist only of alphanumerics and `-`.

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `cpu_speed` (Number) CPU speed in MHz. Will default to the lowest available spec matching all of `model`, `memory` and `cpu_speed`.
- `disk_size` (Number) Disk space size, in GB. Must be a multiple of 10
- `memory` (Number) RAM size in MB. Will default to the lowest available spec matching all of `model`, `memory` and `cpu_speed`.
- `model` (Number) Raspberry Pi model (3 or 4)
- `os_image` (String) Operating system image
- `ssh_key` (String, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Public SSH key(s) to be added to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys on server
- `wait_for_dns` (Boolean, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Whether to wait for DNS records under hostedpi.com to become available before completing provisioning.

### Read-Only

- `ip` (String) IPv6 address for server
- `location` (String) Data centre in which server is located
- `nic_speed` (Number) NIC speed in Mbps. Will default to the lowest available spec matching all of `model`, `memory` and `cpu_speed`.
- `ssh_port` (Number) Port for accessing SSH via IPv4 relay. Server is accessible on `ssh.{identifier}.hostedpi.com`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = mythicbeasts_pi.example
  id = "example"
}

resource "mythicbeasts_pi" "example" {
  identifier = "example"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import mythicbeasts_pi.example example
```
